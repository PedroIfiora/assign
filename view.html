        <h1>Hannibal - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
        <p>
            After defeating the Romans at the Battle of lake Transimene, Hannibal now moved his forces down south.
            There was panic in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maxius was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal, Fabius however refused to 
            meet with Hannibal in the open field and this strategybecame highly unpopular in Rome. Romans were use to attacking, not hiding.
            The romans were his forcs between Rome and its vital grain supply. This se the epic Battle of Cannae, Here Hannibal defeated the Romans inflicting the worst
        </p>
        <h1>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
        <p>After the horrific defeat at the Battle oc Cannae, the Romans reinstituted Fabius 
            avoidance strategy . The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal
            head on collisions, rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal
            , but always at a close distance.
        </p>
        <p>

            the avoidance strategy worked but it took forever. It took almost two long Decades to drive Hannibal
            out of Italy . And even then Hannibal was never defeated in Italy. The Romans, adopting a tactic out of Hannibal
            playbook, launched an attack against Carthage itself. This forced Hannibalto travel back to Africa to defend the city.
            Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama
